# Linux File Commands Cheat Sheet

## 1. `rm` ‚Äì Remove a File or Directory

- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  rm filename
````

* **Examples:**

  ```bash
  rm my_file.txt         # Delete a file
  rm -r my_folder/       # Delete a folder and its contents
  rm -f important.txt    # Force delete without prompt
  ```

---

## 2. `cp` ‚Äì Copy Files or Directories

* **Usage:**

  ```bash
  cp source destination
  ```

* **Examples:**

  ```bash
  cp file.txt backup.txt           # Copy a file
  cp file.txt /home/user/docs/     # Copy file to another folder
  cp -r folder1/ folder2/          # Copy directories recursively
  ```

---

## 3. `touch` ‚Äì Create an Empty File

* **Usage:**

  ```bash
  touch filename
  ```

* **Examples:**

  ```bash
  touch newfile.txt           # Create a new empty file
  touch a.txt b.txt c.txt     # Create multiple files at once
  ```

---

## 4. `mv` ‚Äì Move (or Rename) a File

* **Usage:**

  ```bash
  mv source destination
  ```

### üß™ Example: Move a File

```bash
# Step 1: Create a file
touch file1.txt

# Step 2: Create a folder
mkdir my_project

# Step 3: Move file1.txt into my_project/
mv file1.txt my_project/
```

After running these commands:

* `file1.txt` will no longer be in the current directory.
* It will be inside the `my_project/` folder.

---

### üìù Notes:

* `rm` is irreversible ‚Äì use with caution.
* `cp` keeps the original file intact.
* `touch` is handy for quick test files.
* `mv` is used for both moving and renaming files.

```
